on your browser.

### How to use
The main functionality of Scribase is simple. You can see when scripts other people have made from the Scripts tab. You can also register and become a full user by creating an account from the button found in the top right corner next to the logging in button. Once you are a full user, you can make new scripts to share with other people from the Add a script tab. If you find a script that interests you, you can add it to your favourites easily on the script page. You can also comment on your or other people's scripts by opening one of the scripts from the Scripts tab. Once you're there scroll down to find the commenting box. If you're not happy with your comment or script, or you made one on accident, then you can delete or edit them. If you want to check your personal information, you can go to your personal page, where you'll find all of the scripts, comments, and favourites that you've made. You can see other users' information as well, by clicking on their name on various pages.
